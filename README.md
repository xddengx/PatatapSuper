# PatatapSuper

Class: IGME-531

- Inspiration from Patatap (http://patatap.com/) and Paul Bourke's Superformula (http://paulbourke.net/geometry/supershape/), which were both covered in class. 
- Sound effects from: https://freesound.org/browse/

Controls/Info:
- Using your keyboard press on single/multiple letters a-z (in lowercase!)
- Each letter produces a different sound and shape.

Note: previous versions contained Dat.gui that allowed user to change the attributes. Dat.gui was removed from this latest version because it was conflicting with previous pre-defined drawn shapes (a coding error on my part). I'm planning on updating this, to allow the user to have free functionality for one of the letters. So stay tuned! More featues will also be added.

Have fun!
